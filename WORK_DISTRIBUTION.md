# xWork Distribution — Knurdz Marketplace

> Living document. Update when ownership or MVP scope changes.  
> Agents: after each implementation, check off every **relevant** box below for your change.  
> Detailed step plans + agent how-to: `[docs/agent/](./docs/agent/)` (start with `docs/agent/INDEX.md`).

**Stack:** Next.js · Appwrite · PayHere sandbox · bank transfer · free selling  
**Roles:** Admin · Seller · Buyer

**Sources merged:** prior Knurdz analysis + team “Full Feature Analysis” report (keep stronger options; no duplicate tasks).

---

## Principles

1. **Member 1 unblocks everyone** — finish Phase 0 before others bind UI to real Appwrite APIs.
2. **Quality & security > speed** — see `.cursor/rules/`.
3. **Graphify** — query before coding; `/graphify . --update` (or full rebuild) after meaningful code changes.
4. **Approved MCPs only** — Appwrite, PayHere docs (+ optional Merchant), Context7, next-devtools, shadcn, Playwright (see `.cursor/rules/mcp-acceleration.mdc`). No GitHub MCP; humans own commits/PRs/merges.
5. **Single-seller orders** for MVP (split cart by seller at checkout if needed).
6. **Bank verification policy:** the selling shop approves or rejects bank slips for its own orders (`order.sellerId`). Admin keeps read-only visibility of all orders and pending slips. Change only by updating this file.
7. **Payment setup (Member 1):** PayHere hash + notify Functions, merchant secrets, free-confirm server path, `docs/agent/PAYHERE.md` implementation, webhook/notify logging, sandbox payment notes. **Never** put merchant secret in the client. Member 2 only builds checkout **UX** that calls Member 1 APIs; Member 4 does **not** own PayHere Functions.
8. **MVP first:** working transactions before chat, AI, referrals, or heavy analytics.

## Shared post-implementation checklist (all members)

Use after every change that touches code or schema:

- [x] Re-read own changes end-to-end; no uncertain behavior left unresolved
- [x] AuthZ checked (roles/labels + Appwrite permissions; not UI-only)
- [x] No secrets in client / `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
- [x] IDOR / ownership checks on reads & writes you added — admin-only approve/reject + proxy checks `bankSlipFileExists`; no buyer-facing slip mutation
- [x] Inputs validated (frontend + server); uploads constrained if applicable
- [x] Payment paths (if touched): notify/hash trusted; idempotent; return_url not sole source of truth — bank approve/reject idempotent guards + TablesDB txn; COD accept leaves payment pending; stock reserved at placement; live E2E pending seeded data
- [x] Graphify consulted before work (if graph exists) and updated after
- [x] Relevant Appwrite MCP tools used when touching Appwrite (docs/context/search/call)
- [x] Relevant member checklist items below updated
- [x] Did not break another member’s contract (types, status enums, routes)

## Development phases (team sync)


| Phase                | Focus                                                | Primary owners     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 — Foundation       | Auth, DB, storage, shells, guards                    | Member 1           |
| 2 — Core marketplace | Listings, cart, checkout, orders                     | Members 2–3        |
| 3 — Role systems     | Seller dashboard, admin panel                        | Members 3–4        |
| 4 — Payments         | PayHere Functions + free confirm + payment E2E setup | **Member 1**       |
| 5 — Enhancements     | Reviews, notifications, creative backlog             | As capacity allows |
| **6 — Close remaining MVP** | Seller listings/fulfillment, leftover admin, E2E, then optionals | **Member 1** (claimed) |


---

## Member 1 — Foundation (must-dos first)

**Owns:** repo bootstrap, Appwrite clients, auth, schema, storage helpers, design system, seeds, route guards, shared types, service/API consistency, **payment setup** (PayHere Functions, secrets, free confirm, payment contract implementation). **Also owns Phase 6** (remaining seller + leftover admin + E2E + optionals) — **6.1–6.22 complete**; creative backlog optional next.

### Phase 0 — blockers (do before others ship against APIs)

- [x] Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + lint/format + `.env.example`
- [x] Appwrite project wiring (browser + server clients)
- [x] Auth: register, login, logout, session, password reset, email verify
- [x] Optional phone field on profile / registration (not required for MVP login) — **Phase 6.22**
- [x] Role model (labels/teams) + middleware guards for `/seller`, `/admin`
- [x] Database collections + indexes + permissions documented (`docs/agent/SCHEMA.md` when created) — include at least: profiles/users, products, orders, order_items, payments, reviews (+ seller_profiles, categories, notifications, audit as needed)
- [x] Storage buckets + shared upload helper
- [x] UI kit / layout shells (store, seller, admin empty shells) + navbar/routing
- [x] Shared order/payment status enums & types + thin service layer / API contracts for other members
- [x] Seed: demo admin, seller, buyer, categories
- [x] README setup so teammates can clone and run

### Phase 0 — step-by-step plan (implement one step at a time)

### Phase 1 — ongoing


| Step         | Goal                        | Do                                                                  | Verify                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [x] **1.14** | Auth/upload rate limits     | In-process sliding window on auth + upload server actions           | Burst login/recovery blocked; recovery non-enumerating |
| [x] **1.15** | Notifications badge         | Own-only service + polling bell in store/portal nav + demo seed     | Unread badge; mark read; guest has no bell             |
| [x] **1.16** | Global product search       | `title_fulltext` + `searchActiveProducts` + `/search` verify UI     | Active-only results; empty q → []; demo “sticker” hits |
| [x] **1.17** | Legal / FAQ pages           | Static Terms, Privacy, FAQ + store footer links                     | Routes render; footer links work                       |
| [x] **1.18** | Toasts + errors + loading   | Sonner toasts, segment error.tsx / loading.tsx, profile-form sample | Toast on profile save; error/loading UI present        |
| [x] **1.19** | Platform settings reader    | `getPlatformSetting(s)` + seeded MVP keys                           | Signed-in read; guest → null; unknown key → null       |
| [x] **1.20** | PayHere Function interfaces | `PAYHERE.md` + types + `requestPayHereCheckout` stub (no secrets)   | Contract frozen; missing Function → typed error        |
| [x] **1.21** | A11y / responsive baseline  | Skip link, reduced motion, landmarks, touch targets, form alerts    | Skip→#main-content; login/profile errors wired         |


- [x] In-app notifications collection + badge hook/UI (polling OK for MVP; realtime later)
- [x] Global product search helper
- [x] Basic rate limiting / abuse guards on sensitive auth & upload endpoints (or Function-level)
- [x] Legal / FAQ static pages
- [x] Toasts + error boundary + loading-state patterns
- [x] Platform settings read helper
- [x] Schema changelog when others request fields — **Phase 6.15** (only if 6.x needs new fields)
- [x] PayHere Function **interfaces** (`PAYHERE.md` + types + stub) — implementation is Member 1 payment setup below
- [x] Accessibility / responsive baseline pass
- [x] Role-based post-login redirects (admin → `/admin`, seller → `/seller`, pending seller → `/seller/pending`, buyer → `/market`); exclusive shells; single `/login`
- [x] Fix cross-member integration issues; keep API contracts consistent — **Phase 6.16**

### Payment setup (Member 1 — was formerly Members 2 + 4)

Complete payment infrastructure so Members 2–4 only consume APIs / admin UI.


| Step         | Goal                             | Do                                                                          | Verify                                                             |

| [x] **1.22** | PayHere hash Function            | Appwrite Function `payhere-checkout-hash`; secret in Function env only      | Signed checkout fields from DB order                               |
| [x] **1.23** | PayHere notify Function          | `payhere-notify`; verify md5sig; amount vs order+payment; idempotent `paid` (stock reserved at placement) | Replay notify safe; amount mismatch rejected |
| [x] **1.24** | Free confirm path                | Secure server/Function confirm for `method=free` (no client-trusted amount); stock already reserved | Free orders mark paid once |
| [x] **1.25** | Wire client stub → live Function | `requestPayHereCheckout` calls real hash Function                           | Member 2 can POST sandbox form                                     |
| [x] **1.26** | Notify / webhook failure logging | Persist failed/raw notify for ops (admin-readable later)                    | No secrets in logs/UI                                              |
| [x] **1.27** | Sandbox payment notes            | Test cards + demo steps in `docs/agent/PAYHERE.md`                          | Human-runnable                                                     |
| [x] **1.28** | Payment setup done gate          | Announce to Members 2 & 4                                                   | Free + PayHere sandbox paths work end-to-end with stub/checkout UX |


**Checklist**

- [x] Appwrite Function: PayHere checkout hash
- [x] Appwrite Function: PayHere notify verify + idempotent `paid`
- [x] Free payment confirm (server-side)
- [x] Monitor / log PayHere notify failures
- [x] Sandbox demo / test-card notes
- [x] Merchant secret only in Function env (never `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`)

### Member 1 — done when

- [x] Others can auth, hit empty role dashboards, upload a file, and read seeded products
- [x] Payment setup (1.22–1.28): others can complete free + PayHere sandbox via Member 1 Functions
- [x] Phase 6: remaining seller + leftover admin + E2E (see **6.1–6.18** done-when)

---

## Member 4 — Admin, moderation, trust

**Owns:** `/admin/`**, moderation, read-only bank slip queue, platform settings UI, audit, reports. **Does not** own PayHere Functions or payment setup (Member 1). Sellers approve slips (principle 6).

**Depends on:** Member 1 Phase 0 + payment setup for accurate payment statuses; integrates with Members 2–3 order/listing data.

**Phase 6:** leftover admin tasks (seller performance, order overrides, bank-slip verify extra, **4.14**) are **claimed by Member 1**. Tick mapped **6.x** and Member 4 boxes together.

### Tasks

- [x] Admin dashboard: total users, sellers, orders, revenue insights
- [x] Seller approval queue (approve/reject + reason)
- [x] User management: view, ban/suspend, role tools
- [x] Monitor seller performance (basic metrics) — **Phase 6.12**
- [x] Listing moderation (approve/reject/remove inappropriate)
- [x] Categories CRUD
- [x] All-orders oversight + payment filters
- [x] Dispute handling (orders flagged by buyers/sellers)
- [x] Bank slip queue UI (read-only; sellers approve/reject proofs)
- [x] User/listing reports triage

- [x] Discount coupons admin CRUD (optional — Phase 5 / **6.20**)
- [x] Read-only view of PayHere/notify failure logs (data produced by Member 1) — optional

### Step-by-step plan (implement one step at a time)


| Step         | Goal                    | Do                                        | Verify                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [x] **4.1**  | Admin metrics           | Users, sellers, orders, revenue           | Admin-only              |
| [x] **4.2**  | Seller approval         | Approve → `seller` label; reject + reason | Audit logged            |
| [x] **4.3**  | User management         | View, suspend; block checkout/publish     | Server-side enforcement |
| [x] **4.4**  | Listing moderation      | Approve/reject/remove                     | Status enums only       |
| [x] **4.5**  | Categories CRUD         | Create/update/order                       | Storefront reads them   |
| [x] **4.6**  | All orders + filters    | By payment method/status                  | Admin access only       |
| [x] **4.7**  | Bank slip queue         | Read-only admin view; seller approve → `paid`; reject | Idempotent; audit |
| [x] **4.8**  | Reports / disputes      | Triage workflow                           | Status transitions      |
| [x] **4.9**  | Platform settings UI    | Sandbox, bank copy, fees (admin write)    | Safe public fields only |
| [x] **4.10** | Audit viewer            | List admin actions                        | Append-only             |
| [x] **4.11** | Analytics               | Sales + user growth                       | No PII leakage          |
| [x] **4.12** | Badges + fraud flags    | Verification badge; rule flags            | Rules documented        |
| [x] **4.13** | Notify log viewer (opt) | Read-only UI over Member 1 failure logs   | No secrets in UI        |
| [x] **4.14** | Optional Phase 5        | Featured listings, coupons                | After E2E — **Phase 6.20** |


### Member 4 — verification extras

- [x] Admin actions audited
- [x] Suspended users cannot checkout or publish
- [x] Bank slip approve/reject is seller-owned, idempotent, and audited — **Phase 6.14** (admin queue read-only)
- [x] Does **not** implement PayHere Functions (Member 1)

---

## Phase 6 — Close remaining MVP (Member 1)

**Claimed by Member 1.** Original Member 3/4/2 leftover boxes stay canonical — tick **both** the **6.x** row and the mapped **3.x / 4.x / 2.x** item when a step lands.

**Do not rebuild:** Member 1 Phase 0 + **1.14–1.28**, Member 2 **2.1–2.15**, Member 4 **4.1–4.13**, seller apply/status/shop (**3.1–3.3**). Catalog today is seed-only (`seed_demo_product` / `seed_demo_free_product`).

**MVP close gate:** an approved seller can publish listings (not only seeds), fulfill paid orders, and a human can run free / bank / PayHere sandbox end-to-end.

Implement **one numbered 6.x step at a time**. Start at **6.1**.

### A — Critical path: seller listings → fulfillment

| Step | Maps to | Goal | Do | Verify |
| ---- | ------- | ---- | -- | ------ |
| [x] **6.1** | **3.4** | Create product | Draft + multi-image gallery (Appwrite Storage); own `sellerId` only | IDOR: cannot create as another seller |
| [x] **6.2** | **3.5** | Edit / archive | Update fields; archive | Cannot edit others’ products |
| [x] **6.3** | **3.6** | Publish flow | `draft` → `pending_review` / `active` per policy | Align with existing Member 4 listing moderation |
| [x] **6.4** | **3.7** | Inventory | Stock qty + availability toggle | Unavailable hides buy CTA even if stock > 0 |
| [x] **6.5** | **3.8** | Free listing | `price=0` / `isFree` | Buyer free-confirm works on a seller-created SKU |
| [x] **6.6** | **3.12** | Bank details | Seller account fields for buyer bank checkout | Least exposure (not public beyond need) |
| [x] **6.7** | **3.10** | Order inbox | List this seller’s orders | Filter by `sellerId`; no other sellers’ orders |
| [x] **6.8** | **3.11** | Fulfillment | `processing` → `shipped` / `ready_pickup` → `completed` | Invalid transitions rejected |
| [x] **6.9** | **3.9** | Dashboard KPIs | Orders, revenue, pending | Own data only (after inbox exists) |
| [x] **6.10** | **3.13** | Earnings | Paid orders list; manual payout note | Matches `payments` `paid` |
| [x] **6.11** | **3.14** | Settings | Return/shipping policy text | Visible on public shop / product |

After **6.8**, tick Member 3 verification extras: own-only mutations, unpublished/rejected not buyable, stock cannot go negative on confirm, availability-off hides buy CTA.

### B — Remaining admin (still MVP-ish)

| Step | Maps to | Goal | Do | Verify |
| ---- | ------- | ---- | -- | ------ |
| [x] **6.12** | Member 4 task (no 4.x id) | Seller performance | Basic metrics on approved sellers | Admin-only; depends on **6.9–6.11** data |
| [x] **6.13** | Admin order overrides | Cancel/refund + audit | Coordinate PayHere chargeback / `refunded` (`PAYHERE.md`) | Audited; valid status enums only |
| [x] **6.14** | Member 4 verify extra | Bank-slip idempotency | Re-verify **4.7**; patch only if a gap remains | Idempotent approve/reject + audit; do not rebuild the queue |

### C — Integration (not new features)

| Step | Maps to | Goal | Do | Verify |
| ---- | ------- | ---- | -- | ------ |
| [x] **6.15** | Member 1 ongoing | Schema changelog | Only if **6.1–6.14** or **6.13** need new fields | Update `docs/agent/SCHEMA.md` + console |
| [x] **6.16** | Member 1 ongoing | Contract pass | Status enums, publish policy, stock-on-confirm, bank-detail exposure | No forked status strings |
| [x] **6.17** | Console only | PayHere sandbox E2E | Merchant env + `PAYHERE_NOTIFY_URL` on hash Function | Never git secrets |
| [x] **6.18** | Guide §10 | Full E2E script | Register → admin approve seller → create paid+free → moderate if required → free / bank+slip / PayHere → ship → suspend blocks checkout | Playwright after **6.8** |

### D — After MVP E2E (numbered optionals)

| Step | Maps to | Goal | Do | Verify |
| ---- | ------- | ---- | -- | ------ |
| [x] **6.19** | **2.16** | Trending / recently viewed / reorder | After **6.18**; needs completed orders + browse | Guest-safe; own-only history |
| [x] **6.20** | **4.14** | Featured listings + coupons | Admin-controlled; needs **6.3** `active` products | After E2E |
| [x] **6.21** | **3.15** | Messaging + seller bank-verify | Basic order threads. Seller approves own-order bank slips (principle 6) | Messaging + seller slip review |
| [x] **6.22** | Member 1 Phase 0 optional | Phone on registration | Profile already has phone; register copy still says later | Optional field; not required for login |

### E — Creative backlog last (after Phase 6 E2E)

Same IDs as the table below. Suggested order if capacity remains: **X02** → **X01** → **X03** → **X07** → **X06** (after **6.21** threads) → **X05** → **X04** (needs **6.19** history).

### Phase 6 — done when

- [x] Approved seller publishes a listing; buyer can purchase it (not only seed SKUs)
- [x] Seller sees paid order, ships / completes; earnings match `paid`
- [x] Admin seller-performance + order override paths exist (or explicitly deferred with a note)
- [x] Guide §10 E2E run documented (free + bank + PayHere sandbox)

## Creative & advanced backlog (do not duplicate into MVP lanes)

Pick up only after Phases 1–4 **and Phase 6 A–C** are solid (**6.18**). Assign when claimed. **Member 1** may take these after **6.22**.


| ID  | Item                                        | Suggested owner |
| --- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [x] **UX-1** | Storefront / portal UI polish (landing, `/market`, shared chrome) | Member 1 |
| [x] **UX-2** | Exclusive buyer / seller / admin shells + seller dashboard analytics | Member 1 |
| X01 | CAPTCHA on register/login (optional)        | Member 1        |
| [x] **X02** | Dark/light mode                             | Member 1        |
| X03 | Realtime notifications (vs polling)         | Member 1        |
| X04 | AI product recommendations                  | Later           |
| X05 | Referral system                             | Later           |
| X06 | Full chat system beyond basic threads       | Members 2–3     |
| X07 | Appwrite scale monitoring / limit awareness | Member 1 + 4    |

## Risks (track while implementing)


| Risk                              | Mitigation                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Bank transfer verification delays | Clear buyer status + admin queue SLAs; reminders      |
| Fake sellers / spam               | Approval gate, badges, reports, suspend tools         |
| Appwrite limits                   | Lean queries, indexes, avoid N+1; monitor usage       |
| UI scope creep                    | Freeze MVP checklists; park extras in backlog above   |
| Payment secret leakage            | **Member 1** Functions only; Member 2 UX-only PayHere |

## Suggested timeline


| When       | Focus                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1     | Member 1 Phase 0; others wireframe / mock only                    |
| Week 1 end | Schema freeze v1 + seed                                           |
| Weeks 2–3  | Members 2–4 implement portals (Phases 2–3)                        |
| Week 3     | E2E payments: Member 1 setup + Member 2 UX + Member 4 bank verify |
| Week 4     | Hardening, demo, Phase 5 extras if ahead                          |
| **Now**    | **Phase 6 (Member 1):** **6.1–6.22** complete; creative backlog **X01–X07** optional next |

## Status enums (do not fork)

**Product:** `draft`  `pending_review`  `active`  `rejected`  `archived`  
**Payment method:** `payhere`  `bank_transfer`  `free`  `cod` (PayHere gated by `checkout.payhere_enabled`)  
**Payment status:** `pending`  `awaiting_verification`  `paid`  `failed`  `refunded`  
**Order (simplified):** `pending_payment` → `payment_review` → `paid` → `processing` → `shipped` / `ready_pickup` → `completed`  `cancelled` / `refunded`  
**COD:** `pending_payment` → `processing` (payment stays `pending`) → `shipped` / `ready_pickup` → `completed` (payment → `paid` on that hop)
